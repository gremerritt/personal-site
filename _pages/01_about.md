I am currently a graduate student at Boston University, where I'm working on completing a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering. I love building things with code, and experimenting with new technologies. When I'm not doing those things, I'm probably working on bikes or playing board games.

Some interesting projects that I've worked on include:

  - <span style="font-size: smaller;">A flexible and customizable Neural Net, written in C with OpenMP. When used for [Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) it was able to correctly classify over 96% of handwritten characters. [(Link)]({{site.github}}/neural-net-OCR)</span>
  - <span style="font-size: smaller;">Solving the [Laplace Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation), and in particular the [Heat Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation) on an [Icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron). [(Link)]({{site.github}}/icosahedral-lattice)</span>
  - <span style="font-size: smaller;">A Dropbox integration for iTunes on OSX. Written in Ruby, the app will dynamically download music located in a user's Dropbox onto the local machine. This way all music can be kept in the cloud, but the user can still use iTunes. [(Link)]({{site.github}}/henchman)</span>
