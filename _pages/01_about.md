I am currently a graduate student at Boston University, where I'm working on completing a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering. I am especially interested in Machine Learning techniques and learning more about how they can be applied in the creation of cutting-edge technologies.

Some interesting projects that I've worked on include:

  - <span style="font-size: smaller;">A flexible and customizable Neural Net, written in C with OpenMP. When used for [Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) it was able to correctly classify over 96% of handwritten characters. [(Link)]({{site.github}}/neural-net-OCR)</span>
  - <span style="font-size: smaller;">Solving the [Laplace Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation), and in particular the [Heat Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation) on an [Icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron). [(Link)]({{site.github}}/icosahedral-lattice)</span>
  - <span style="font-size: smaller;">A Dropbox integration for iTunes on OSX. Written in Ruby, the app will dynamically download music located in a user's Dropbox onto the local machine. This way all music can be kept in the cloud, but the user can still use iTunes. [(Link)]({{site.github}}/henchman)</span>
